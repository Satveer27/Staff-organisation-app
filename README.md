# Staff-organisation-app
This the small frontend portfolio website for engineers. This project was made with redux, react js and tailwind css as the frontend and for the backend nodejs, expressjs and mongodb was used. The features of the application is as stated below:

# 1.) Users
* Users can view the home page and frontend elements in the homepage
* Users can contact the company to ask for more details via the contact us form which was made by email.js
* Users can also view all employees and the project made
* Employees are displayed via zones.
<br />

# 2.) Admins
* Admins have their own authentication system that has the login features where admins can login with a correct email and password<br />
* Admins can perform CRUD functionality towards the employees being displayed(via changing their zones).
* Admins have their own dashboard to view all the employees displayed.
* Normal users cant access admin dashboard and admins have their own features as mentioned above.
<br />

# Functionalities

All these functionality as above was created with the use of an staff api at the backend(which was created by me as well) and for the frontend react was used to handle forms and display. Redux was used as a form of state managment to ensure that everything returned from the api is stored as a state.
